Create your first Java pipeline
Sign-in to your Azure DevOps organization and go to your project.

Go to Pipelines, and then select New pipeline.

Do the steps of the wizard by first selecting GitHub as the location of your source code.

You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If so, enter your GitHub credentials.

When you see the list of repositories, select your repository.

You might be redirected to GitHub to install the Azure Pipelines app. If so, select Approve & install.

Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository and recommend the Maven pipeline template.

When your new pipeline appears, take a look at the YAML to see what it does. When you're ready, select Save and run.

You're prompted to commit a new azure-pipelines.yml file to your repository. After you're happy with the message, select Save and run again.

If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select the build job.

You just created and ran a pipeline that we automatically created for you, because your code appeared to be a good match for the Maven template.

You now have a working YAML pipeline (azure-pipelines.yml) in your repository that's ready for you to customize!

When you're ready to make changes to your pipeline, select it in the Pipelines page, and then Edit the azure-pipelines.yml file.
